"EasyEquities/ SatrixNOW"," South Africa"," InvestTech"," https://www.easyequities.co.za/"," EasyEquities CEO: Charles H Savage / SatrixNOW CEO: Helena Conradie","https://www.linkedin.com/in/charles-savage-92b936"," @EasyEquities and/or @SATRIX_SA","EasyEquities/ SatrixNOWEasyEquities is an online investment platform which makes it fun, easy and cheap for anyone to buy shares. The platform has replaced the jargon and intimidating fees you’d expect to find on other stockbroking platforms, with simple explanations and helpful recommendations – think Facebook, Uber and Amazon. There's no minimum investment, no monthly fees and the lowest trading costs in the market (investors pay only 64c per R100 invested) \n \n        Satrix and EasyEquities have the same endgame in mind – to deliver a slick, easy-to-use investing platform. That’s why they partnered in the rollout of SatrixNOW. Satrix is a leading provider of index-tracking investment products in South Africa with more than R50 billion in assets under management invested in a wide range of retail and institutional offerings. They offer both unit trusts and exchange traded funds (ETFs). \n\nHaving already established a low cost platform that enables people to invest in South African shares and ETF’s, the team has since developed the availability to invest in a selection of US stocks and ETFs as well. It has also produced products and solutions to cater to new customer needs; many of which surround developing good saving habits, gaining a better understanding of what to invest in, and building portfolios in line with their personal financial goals and investment styles. The first of these products was Baskets; a collection of shares that are pre-selected and weighted by a financial analyst, asset manager or personality. Baskets enable people to invest in a diversified portfolio of shares or Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) that are associated with different levels of risk, with whatever investment amount they have available. Seeing the need for a more managed offering resulted in the development of a similar but more sophisticated tool: Bundles. Bundles, like baskets, offer users access to a portfolio of shares or ETFs based on their risk appetite but are chosen, weighted and rebalanced by an asset manager, giving users access to advanced investment strategies which they might have otherwise been excluded from or out of their financial reach. \n \n        "

Our vision is to give biometric identity and affordable access to basic financial services to the unbanked. We do this by solving these three barriers to financial inclusion: 1. Lack of identity: The problem is that unbanked consumers often do not have any formal documents to prove their identity. Our solution: We create a biometric identity using their ten fingerprints to substitute formal identity documents creating a paperless Know-Your-Customer (KYC) database. 2. Low Connectivity: The problem is that many consumers live in areas where internet infrastructure is non-existent or very unreliable. Our solution: Our technology still works in low connectivity areas. In the event of zero connectivity, two transactions (Make A Payment or Withdraw Cash) can be done offline in real-time. 3. High cost: The problem is that low-income consumers cannot afford the high fees of a traditional bank account. Our solution: We create a national payment (card) scheme that provides bank accounts to consumers at a fraction of the cost of traditional bank accounts.

Over and above the South African market, i-Pay is in the process of expanding its footprint into other markets globally, with Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, and Australia planned to go live at the end of July 2017, with an additional five European locations by end of December 2017. The system is completely card-less and transactions are concluded in under 45 seconds. Payments can be made via eCommerce sites, SMS, Email, QR Code or via Push Payments. Unlike the traditional payment methods, there is no need for consumers to load beneficiaries, reference numbers and amounts due for payment. The software automatically populates this information, mitigating the risk of the consumer capturing information incorrectly. The merchant has absolute certainty that the amounts will be received on all successful transactions and are allocated accurately, based on the reference number linked to the payment. Three of our main competitive advantages currently is: 1. Faster: i-Pay processes payments for its clients and their end users much faster than its competitors. 2. Customisable: i-Pay’s back-end functionality makes it very customisable to the needs of a business (as opposed to the standard, rigid offerings of competitors). 3. Cutting edge software: i-Pay has developed a cutting edge software that is able to adapt fast to bank changes. Our Value Proposition: South African banks lost R252.2m in card fraud in 2015 according to Sabric (sabric.co.za/media-and-news/posts/card-fraud-booklets). Online payments are cumbersome with payments taking up to 48 hours or more to reflect, depending on the bank and prone to fraud. Globally, card fraud losses reached $21.84b and are projected to increase to $31.67b in 2020. One of the reasons for such a fraud risk on cards is that the card as we know it was never designed to facilitate on-line payments. Providing the 16 digit card number, with expiry dates, CVV security code and card holder name exposes the consumer to, not only identity theft but cyber fraud as well. Our system mitigates this risk as it is a completely cardless system. Furthermore, we made absolutely certain that our software is water tight from a cybercrime perspective and continue to work on enhancement. We have been around for the past three years and are currently processing over R1b worth of transactions. To date, we have not received a single report of fraudulent activity on our platform. This does not mean that there have not been attempts. But everyone was unsuccessful.\n        "

EGM provides the opportunity for clients who previously had to face the hassles of operating a U.S. dollar-denominated account to access financial markets. To achieve this feat, the company took into consideration the most pressing needs of traders and investors and went ahead to build their proprietary platform called the CloudTrade. Eagle Global Markets not only makes trading global markets more accessible but we also address issues such as a local currency risk and having to contract with foreign entities.

Using simple mobile phone technology, alternative data sets, and sophisticated data analytics, FarmDrive is closing the critical information gap that keeps smallholder farmers from loans that would allow them to grow and diversify their businesses.Problem \nPotentially creditworthy smallholder farmers are often denied loans because they lack the traditional credit profiles that lenders rely on to evaluate borrowers. Financial institutions do not have well-designed and operationally efficient methods of accurately assessing and managing smallholder farmers’ risk, making them reluctant to lend to farmers. Farmers are therefore left with little access to credit, and financial institutions with a hole in their client base and product line.Solution \nTo bridge this gap, FarmDrive is developing an innovative credit assessment model that provides detailed risk profiles on smallholder farmers to financial institutions. FarmDrive’s comprehensive algorithms generate credit profiles and tailor-made loan products for farmers based on the nature of their farming activities. Thus, when farmers apply for a loan using the mobile application, financial institutions are presented with pre-vetted clients and individualized loan products that are further de-risked with weather-index insurance. This solution will not only unlock millions of dollars of previously risk-averse capital for smallholder farmers, it will improve the livelihoods of entire communities, thereby alleviating poverty, hunger, and inequality. Since launching the platform in December 2015, over 2000 farmers have joined the platform, and FarmDrive disbursed 350 loans totaling over KES 12 million (USD 120,000). \n        "

The ledger uses its own unit of account, also called kobocoin(s).\nThe kobocoin blockchain is distributed, to independently verify the chain of ownership of each and every kobocoin amount. The wallet on your device is a node. It works to maintain the security and integrity of the blockchain along with all other nodes. There is no central database. This is the decentralized nature of the Kobocoin ecosystem.\nIn the Kobocoin ecosystem every person who holds a funded wallet (or a funded kobocoin address to be more precise) becomes a stakeholder. This entitles them to freshly minted kobocoins as a reward for helping maintain the integrity of the blockchain (10% per annum credited daily). Stakeholders are rewarded with freshly minted kobocoins until the full allocation is in circulation. From then on, all rewards will be based on the transaction fees generated within the ecosystem.\n        "

We continue to see new mobile payment frameworks aimed at leveraging the opportunity at the base of the economic pyramid in the personal banking and remittances space. This sector remains highly fragmented as each new player builds a mobile money silo in direct competition with all of the others in the market.However in the much overlooked B2B arena, Africa has yet to experience an equivalent wave of innovation relating to international business payments. As a highly import-dependent continent, Africa currently lacks a low cost, easily accessible means to facilitate international payments efficiently and seamlessly. This leaves it at a significant disadvantage compared to many other industrialised markets.Founded by West African-born Leslie Onyesoh and supported by Kenyan born Amit Khosla, Kwanji provides a direct solution to this problem by connecting global forex supply with demand.Kwanji is a B2B FX comparison platform bridging the payments gap between emerging and established markets. Businesses can compare multiple FX quotes from regulated financial institutions  in seconds, executing international trades quickly and efficiently, better protecting and increasing their bottom line. Kwanji is now positioned to become the driving force for change for B2B payments across Africa and beyond.\n        "

In African, only 23% of the entire population have access to formal banking services. This means 77% of the population are either unbanked or are under banked. This is not because the population does not want to bank, but because the banks are failing consumers and forcing them out of the banking system due to their expensive and outdated services and systems. Most bank often charge fees of up to 20% of consumer’s income in the form of: Monthly maintenance fee, Service fee, Interests, Deposit fee, Withdrawal fee, Account balance fee, [And transport to and from the bank].\n\nThis therefore forces so many people to develop other informal ways of handling and managing their finances by mostly keeping and hiding money at home, carrying out a majority of their financial operations in cash, with the risk of not having any trace of transactions carried out. Some employers who for sympathy of their employees who are highly charged by banks, have develop the habit of paying their workers in cash. This in most cases exposes them to robbery on their way home, and to the employer, the risk of not having a traceable record of previous payments.\n\nThere are equally so many Africans expats (Africans who live and work abroad) and who are always in the need of sending money or gifts home to their parents or loved ones. But in most cases, they are always robbed with high transfer charges (8% to 12%) and manipulated exchange rates by the mainstream international money transfer agents. And even when they have to do this, they leave the comfort of their homes or offices, get to sales points and line up in queues, fill a lot of papers, before being able to carry out their operations.

People the world over are choosing digital as a more efficient, convenient solution for their banking needs, enabling them to bank on their terms. As a direct result, we’ve seen our mobile traffic grow by 100% a year, in-branch transactions decline and ATM usage now makes up less than 5% of total banking transactions. Digital is clearly the present and future.\n\nThough 95% of our transactions are already electronic, making us a truly digital bank, we still aim to deliver an even better customer experience. Our smartphone app, for example, is designed to give you a single, instant view of your complete banking services, regardless of where you are or the products you’ve chosen. It includes the ability to open accounts online, move money across borders, trade shares internationally and even lodge homeowner insurance claims. With the benefits in mind, it’s no mystery that the move to mobile has been so enthusiastically received:\n\n• Most customers now bank outside of traditional banking hours\n• To date, the total number of unique Standard Bank universal banking IDs created is more than 600 000\n• So far, over R5.7 billion has been traded on Standard Bank’s Online Share Trading App\n• Over 22 000 merchants and more than 200 000 customers have signed up for SnapScan\n• InstantMoney has processed more than R7.5 billion in transfers and remittances.\n\nCurrently, Africa’s smartphone penetration stands at 60%. As we strive to become a digital leader, we must leverage this fact as our apps evolve: Our aim is to be always on and always connected through current, accessible technology like smartphones and tablets, further personalising customer experience on the continent. To this end, we have placed you at the heart of our digital strategy, resulting in numerous first-to-market innovations:\n\n• The single digital ID across multiple countries\n• Biometric identification for mobile banking\n• An app enabling clients to trade across 29 different stock exchanges off their mobile device\n• 24/7 Banking instant messaging service for Private & Prestige customers\n• A card console to remotely turn cards on and off, and control when and where they may be used\n• Snapscan, which enables mobile phone payments using QR codes or iBeacons, regardless of where customers bank.\n\nAccording to Peter Schlebusch, Chief Executive for Personal & Business Banking, the customer experience of the future will be worlds apart from what it was a few years ago; digital platforms will better understand and anticipate customer behaviour, and only one click will achieve multiple outcomes. These future capabilities will not only be more convenient and engaging, but will also cost less – a trend that will continue as more consumers embrace digital channels. And Standard Bank aims to be at the forefront of this trend.\n        "
